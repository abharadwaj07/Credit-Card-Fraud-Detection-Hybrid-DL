# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

### The objective of this project is to identify customers who have committed fraud on their Credit Card application 

This was achieved by applying hybrid deep learning model (combining unsupervised and supervised DL models). In the unsupervised learning part, SOM (Self-Organizing Maps) is used to detect customers who potentially had committed fraud in their applications. In the supervised learning part, a simple ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) is used to determine the probability of these customers committing fraud.

The entire code is available in the hybrid_dl.py file.

Dataset used is Credit_Card_Applications.csv
